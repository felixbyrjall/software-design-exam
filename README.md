# Next Gaming - A recommendation system

---Quick start guide---
<p>To get started with the application after it is run or compiled, the navigation menu should
pop up giving you 5 options to choose from, using key presses to navigate up/down the
menu and hitting enter on selection choice.</p>
<p>Inside the Browse menu, you can navigate through the games in the existing library, each
page displays up to 10 games and scrolling through is done by hitting the next and previous
page options. Selecting a game will display the game’s information and give you the options
to either remove or add the game to your interest list or go back.</p>
<p>Inside the interest list you’ll get a display of the games added, these can also be selected and
inspected. You’ll also have two new menu options: “Add games to interest list” and “look for
recommendations”.</p>
<p>If you select the navigation option “Add games to interest list”, you’ll be navigated to an inner
menu/list displaying only games that are not inside your interest list. It will also have
dynamic count which shows how many games that are left.</p>
<p>Going back, you will return to the interest list. The last option in this menu, look for
recommendations, will navigate you to the recommended games page. This page will only
display recommendations if you have games inside your interest list, giving you top 5 games
matching your interests. This page can also be accessed through the main menu, through the
third option, “recommendations”.</p>
<p>No matter which menu you are in, by selecting a game and pressing enter, you'll get
prompted with a menu that lets you either add or remove said game, based on if the game is
already in your interest list.</p>
<p>The fourth option is “Reset” this is more of a development functionality that we wanted to
keep in case the user wants to reset their interest list. The last option is to exit the
programming.</p>
